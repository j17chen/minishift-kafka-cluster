# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# Zookeeper连接字符串（具体见Zookeeper文档）
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# 这是一个以逗号为分割的部分，每一个都匹配一个Zookeeper
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
# 您还可以将一个可选的chroot字符串附加到url，以指定所有kafka znode的根目录。
zookeeper.connect=zkserver-0.zkserver.kafkastreaming.svc.cluster.local:2181,zkserver-1.zkserver.kafkastreaming.svc.cluster.local:2181,zkserver-2.zkserver.kafkastreaming.svc.cluster.local:2181
# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
# 连接到Zookeeper的超时时间
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000

############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################

# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.
# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.
# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.
# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.
group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms=0
